An Open Source RCL Meter

- This project will be crated using orcad at some point is will try to port the schematics and board files over to a more open software package such as eagle in the future

- All of the code for this project will be writen in either atmel studio or MPLABx

Goals 

 - create a fucntioning kelvin connected auto balancing bridge that is capable of messuring R, L, C values to hobbist standards 
 
 R: range from 0.001 <ohm <100M +-2% 
 L: range from 1nH to 100mH +- 2%
 C: range from 1pf to 100mf +-2%
 
 My plan is to have the meter be a stand alone unit with minimal indicator and/ or display. the majorty of the data colected by the meter should be transmited over serial to a computer that will be used to preform some data prossessing and display the relevent data
